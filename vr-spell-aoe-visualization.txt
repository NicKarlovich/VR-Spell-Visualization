Comments:

There is a lot going on in this project!  This was interesting and creative.  It took a while to get the hang of the precision and pointer modes, but once I figured out the controls, it was pretty intuitive.  The gestures in the avatar stance also worked well.  The application was quite polished, and I did not encounter any bugs.

The only minor issue is that there is perhaps an over-reliance on controller buttons, particularly with the spell creation interface.  Some of this could be accomplished using spatial interactions (e.g., why can't I just grab or point to the spell shape I want with my other controller?).  I found myself often selecting the wrong button by mistake.  Some spatial tooltips on the controllers could potentially mitigate this.  This is a relatively minor quibble, though. 

Great job overall!
